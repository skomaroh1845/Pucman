# Pucman
Several years ago I created my first computer game via C++ - pucman, it was coded procedural code (without classes and other OOP features) and had a one huge program file with more than thousand lines and big number of global variables and crutches. Now I have decided to refactor it and recoded with OOP principles. The repository also contains this old version of my masterpiece, you can find it's  .exe file in "OLD version" folder.
