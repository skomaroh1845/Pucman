# Pucman
Several years ago I created my first computer game via C++ - pucman, it was coded procedural code (without classes and other OOP features) and had a one huge program file with more than thousand lines and big number of global variables and crutches. Now I have decided to refactor it and recoded with OOP principles. The repository also contains this old version of my masterpiece, you can find it's  .exe file in "OLD version" folder. There is a screenshot of it below.
